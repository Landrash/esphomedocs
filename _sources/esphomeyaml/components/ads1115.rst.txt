ADS1115 Hub
===========

The ``ads1115`` domain creates a global hub so that you can later create
individual sensors using the `ADS1115 Sensor
Platform </esphomeyaml/components/sensor/ads1115.html>`__. To use this
hub, first setup the `I²C Bus </esphomeyaml/components/i2c.html>`__ and
connect the sensor to the pins specified there.

    ads1115:
      - address: 0x48

Configuration variables:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **address** (**Required**, int): The i²c address of the sensor. See
   `I²C Addresses <#i2c-addresses>`__ for more information.
-  **id** (*Optional*,
   `id </esphomeyaml/configuration-types.html#id>`__): Manually specify the ID for this ADS1115 Hub. Use this if you
   want to use multiple ADS1115 hubs at once.

I²C Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to allow multiple sensors to be connected to the same i²c bus,
the creators of this sensor hardware have included some options to
change the i²c address.

-  If the address pin is pulled to GND, the address is ``0x48``
   (Default).
-  If the address pin is pulled to VCC, the address is ``0x49``.
-  If the address pin is tied to SDA, the address is ``0x4a``.
-  If the address pin is tied to SCL, the address is ``0x4B``.
