ADS1115 Sensor
==============

The ``ads1115`` sensor allows you to use your ADS1115 sigma-delta ADC
sensors (`datasheet <http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1115.pdf>`__,
`adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085>`__) with esphomelib.
First, setup a `ADS1115 Hub </esphomeyaml/components/ads1115.html>`__ for your ADS1115 sensor and then use this
sensor platform to create individual sensors that will report the
voltage to Home Assistant.

Configuration variables:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **multiplexer** (**Required**): The multiplexer channel of this sensor. Effectively means between which pins you
   want to measure voltage.
-  **gain** (**Required**, float): The gain of this sensor.
-  **name** (**Required**, string): The name for this sensor.
-  **ads1115_id** (*Optional*, `id </esphomeyaml/configuration-types.html#id>`__): Manually specify the ID of the
   `ADS1115 Hub </esphomeyaml/components/ads1115.html>`__ you want to use this sensor.
-  **id** (*Optional*, `id </esphomeyaml/configuration-types.html#id>`__): Manually specify
   the ID used for code generation.

Multiplexer And Gain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADS1115 has a multiplexer that can be configured to measure voltage between several pin configurations. These are:

 - ``A0_A1`` (between Pin 0 and Pin 1)
 - ``A0_A3`` (between Pin 0 and Pin 3)
 - ``A1_A3`` (between Pin 1 and Pin 3)
 - ``A2_A3`` (between Pin 2 and Pin 3)
 - ``A0_GND`` (between Pin 0 and GND)
 - ``A1_GND`` (between Pin 1 and GND)
 - ``A2_GND`` (between Pin 2 and GND)
 - ``A3_GND`` (between Pin 3 and GND)

Additionally, the ADS1115 has a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) that can help you measure voltages in different ranges, these are:

 - ``6.144`` (measures up to 6.144V)
 - ``4.096`` (measures up to 4.096V)
 - ``2.048`` (measures up to 2.048V)
 - ``1.024`` (measures up to 1.024V)
 - ``0.512`` (measures up to 0.512V)
 - ``0.256`` (measures up to 0.256V)
